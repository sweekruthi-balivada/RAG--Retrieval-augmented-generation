chief financial officer, gap inc. “we continue t o believe we are taking the right steps toward positioning gap inc. back on its path towards sustainable, profitable growth and delivering value for our shareholders over the long term.” the company’s outlook takes into consideration the continued uncertai n consumer and macro environment. the company is estimating second quarter net sales could decrease in the mid to high -single digit range compared to last year’s net sales of $ 3.86 billion. as a reminder, t he sale of gap china to baozun inc. closed on january 31, 2023. second quarter 2022 net sales included approximately $ 60 million in sales for gap china. the company continues to anticipate that fiscal 2023 net sales could decrease in the low to mid -single digit range compared to last year’s net sales of $15.6 billion . as a reminder, fiscal 2022 net sales included approximately $300 million in sales for gap china. fiscal 2023 will include a 53rd week estimated to positively impact net sales by $150 million. the company expect s second quarter and fiscal 2023 gross margin expansion compared to the prior year. at the estimated level of sales described above, the company is planning adjusted sg&a of approximately $1.3 billion in the second quarter and continues to anticipate approximately $5.2 billion for fiscal 2023. the company now expects fiscal 20 23 capital expenditures in the range of $500 million to $525 million, compared to its prior range of $500 million to $550 million, reflecting lower capital project investments and fewer old navy and athleta store openings than previously contemplated. webcast and conference call information cammeron mclaughlin, head of investor relations at gap inc., will host a conference call to review the

this press release and related conference call include financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and are therefore referred to as non -gaap financial measures. the non -gaap measures described below are intended to provide investors with additional useful information about the company’s financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by managemen t for financial and operating decision -making. the company presents these non-gaap financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. additional information regarding the intended use of each non- gaap measure included in this press release and related conference call is provided in the tables to this press release. the non -gaap measures included in this press release and related conference call are adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating expenses/adjusted sg&a, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjust ed net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow , as well as expected adjusted operating expenses/adjusted sg&a . these non -gaap measures exclude the impact of certain items that are set forth in the tables to this press release . also note that a reconciliation of expected adjusted operating expenses/adjusted sg&a is not provided, in reliance on the exception provided under item 10(e)(1)(i)(b) of regulation s -k, because a comparable gaap measure is not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be necessary for such reconciliation. namely, we are not able to reliably predict the impact of many of the costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future that could impact operating expenses/sg&a . in addition, we believe such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. the variability of those costs and expenses may be material and have a significant and unpredictable impact on our future gaap results. the non -gaap measures used by the company should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. the company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures included in the tables to this press release below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. the non-gaap financial measures used by the company have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. forward -looking statements this press release and related conference call contain forward -looking statements within
